					<p align="justify">Radiative and dynamical heating rates control stratospheric temperatures. We used a radiative transfer model to estimated the radiative contributions to polar stratospheric temperature trends from historical ozone losses and increasing well-mixed greenhouse gases. While it is widely known that the Antarctic ozone hole cools the lower stratosphere in austral spring. Our results show that the radiative cooling due to this pronounced ozone loss is stronger than observed, suggesting dynamical compensation by increased wave activity. In comparison, the Arctic spring cooling due to ozone is relatively weak, and the winter and spring Arctic temperatures are largely influenced by dynamics.</p>

By analyzing winters without major sudden stratospheric warmings, we found that the Arctic polar stratosphere has cooled substantially and the polar jet has strengthened over the past 30 years. Furthermore, we found these trends extend into the upper most troposphere, suggesting dynamical coupling between the stratosphere and troposphere.</p>

						High-frequency, in situ observations from the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE), for the period 2003 to 2012, combined with
						archive flask measurements dating back to 1977, have been used to capture the rapid growth of HFC-143a (CH<sub>3</sub>CF<sub>3</sub>) and HFC-32 (CH<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>) mole fractions
						and emissions into the atmosphere. Here we report the first in situ global measurements of these two gases. HFC-143a and HFC-32 are the third
						and sixth most abundant hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) respectively and they currently make an appreciable contribution to the HFCs in terms of
						atmospheric radiative forcing (1.7 ± 0.04 and 0.7 ± 0.02 mW m<sup>−2</sup> in 2012 respectively). In 2012 the global average mole fraction of HFC-143a
						was 13.4 ± 0.3 ppt (1σ) in the lower troposphere and its growth rate was 1.4 ± 0.04 ppt yr<sup>−1</sup>; HFC-32 had a global mean mole fraction of 6.2 ± 0.2
						ppt and a growth rate of 1.1 ± 0.04 ppt yr<sup>−1</sup> in 2012. The extensive observations presented in this work have been combined with an atmospheric
						transport model to simulate global atmospheric abundances and derive global emission estimates. It is estimated that 23 ± 3 Gg yr<sup>−1</sup> of HFC-143a
						and 21 ± 11 Gg yr<sup>−1</sup> of HFC-32 were emitted globally in 2012, and the emission rates are estimated to be increasing by 7 ± 5% yr<sup>−1</sup> for HFC-143a
						and 14 ± 11% yr<sup>−1</sup> for HFC-32.

						Fundamental differences in observed ozone depletion between the Arctic and the Antarctic are shown,

						have not yet been measured in the Arctic in any year, including the unusually cold Arctic spring of 2011. The data provide direct evidence

						Atmospheric measurements show that emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons are now the primary drivers of
						the positive growth in synthetic greenhouse gas (SGHG) radiative forcing. We infer recent SGHG emissions and examine the impact of
						future emissions scenarios, with a particular focus on proposals to reduce HFC use under the Montreal Protocol. If these proposals are
						implemented, overall SGHG radiative forcing could peak at around 355 mW m<sup>−2</sup> in 2020, before declining by approximately 26% by 2050,
						despite continued growth of fully fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions. Compared to “no HFC policy” projections, this amounts to a reduction
						in radiative forcing of between 50 and 240 mW m<sup>−2</sup> by 2050 or a cumulative emissions saving equivalent to 0.5 to 2.8 years of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
						at current levels. However, more complete reporting of global HFC emissions is required, as less than half of global emissions are currently

						Dynamical coupling between the stratospheric and tropospheric circumpolar circulations in the Arctic has been widely documented on
						month-to-month and interannual time scales, but not on longer time scales. In the Antarctic, both short- and long-term coupling
						extending from the stratosphere to the surface has been identified. In this study, changes in Arctic temperature, geopotential height,
						and ozone observed since the satellite era began in 1979 are examined, comparing dynamically quiescent years in which major sudden
						stratospheric warmings did not occur to all years. It is shown that this approach clarifies the behavior for years without major warmings
						and that dynamically quiescent years are marked by a strengthening of the Arctic polar vortex over the past 30 years. The associated
						declines in stratospheric temperatures, geopotential height, and ozone are qualitatively similar to those obtained in the Antarctic
						(albeit weaker), and propagate downward into the Arctic lowermost stratosphere during late winter and early spring. In sharp contrast
						to the Antarctic, the strengthening of the Arctic stratospheric vortex appears to originate at a higher altitude, and the propagation
						to the Arctic troposphere is both very limited and confined to the uppermost troposphere, even when only dynamically quiescent years

						Nitrogen trifluoride (NF<sub>3</sub>) has potential to make a growing contribution to the Earth’s radiative budget; however, our understanding of its
						atmospheric burden and emission rates has been limited. Based on a revision of our previous calibration and using an expanded set of
						atmospheric measurements together with an atmospheric model and inverse method, we estimate that the global emissions of NF<sub>3</sub> in 2011 were
						1.18 ± 0.21 Gg⋅y<sup>−1</sup>, or ∼20 Tg CO<sub>2</sub>-eq⋅y<sup>−1</sup> (carbon dioxide equivalent emissions based on a 100-y global warming potential of 16,600 for NF<sub>3</sub>).
						The 2011 global mean tropospheric dry air mole fraction was 0.86 ± 0.04 parts per trillion, resulting from an average emissions growth rate of
						0.09 Gg⋅y<sup>−2</sup> over the prior decade. In terms of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents, current NF<sub>3</sub> emissions represent between 17% and 36% of the emissions of other
						long-lived fluorinated compounds from electronics manufacture. We also estimate that the emissions benefit of using NF<sub>3</sub> over hexafluoroethane
						(C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>) in electronics manufacture is significant—emissions of between 53 and 220 Tg CO<sub>2</sub>-eq⋅y<sup>−1</sup> were avoided during 2011. Despite these savings,
						total NF<sub>3</sub> emissions, currently ∼10% of production, are still significantly larger than expected assuming global implementation of ideal
						industrial practices. As such, there is a continuing need for improvements in NF<sub>3</sub> emissions reduction strategies to keep pace with its
						increasing use and to slow its rising contribution to anthropogenic climate forcing.

						forcing (Montzka and Reimann, 2011; Oram et al., 2012). The growth rates of the heavy perfluorocarbons were largest in the late 1990s peaking
						at 6.2 parts per quadrillion (ppq, i.e., parts per 10<sup>15</sup>) per year (yr) for C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>10</sub>, at 5.0 ppq yr<sup>-1</sup> for C<sub>5</sub>F<sub>12</sub> and 16.6 ppq yr<sup>-1</sup> for C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>14</sub> and in
						the early 1990s for C<sub>7</sub>F<sub>16</sub> at 4.7 ppq yr<sup>-1</sup> and in the mid 1990s for C<sub>8</sub>F<sub>18</sub> at 4.8 ppq yr<sup>-1</sup>. The 2011 globally averaged mean atmospheric growth
						rates of these PFCs are subsequently lower at 2.2 ppq yr<sup>-1</sup> for C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>10</sub>, 1.4 ppq yr<sup>-1</sup> for C<sub>5</sub>F<sub>12</sub>, 5.0 ppq yr<sup>−1</sup> for C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>14</sub>, 3.4 ppq yr<sup>-1</sup> for C<sub>7</sub>F<sub>16</sub>
						and 0.9 ppq yr<sup>-1</sup> for C<sub>8</sub>F<sub>18</sub>. The more recent slowdown in the growth rates suggests that emissions are declining as compared to the 1980s and
						1990s.

						We present an analytical method for the in situ measurement of atmospheric nitrogen trifluoride (NF<sub>3</sub>), an anthropogenic gas with a 100-year
						global warming potential of over 16,000. This potent greenhouse gas has a rising atmospheric abundance due to its emission from a growing
						number of manufacturing processes and an expanding end-use market. Here we present a modified version of the “Medusa” preconcentration gas
						chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) system of Miller et al. (2008). By altering the techniques of gas separation and chromatography after initial preconcentration,
						we are now able to make atmospheric measurements of NF<sub>3</sub> with relative precision <2% (1σ) for current background clean air samples. Importantly,
						this method augments the currently operational Medusa system, so that the quality of data for species already being measured is not compromised and
						NF<sub>3</sub> is measured from the same preconcentrated sample. We present the first in situ measurements of NF<sub>3</sub> from La Jolla, California made 11 times daily,
						illustrating how global deployment of this technique within the AGAGE (Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment) network could facilitate estimation
						of global and regional NF<sub>3</sub> emissions over the coming years.

						We report on ground-based atmospheric measurements and emission estimates of the four anthropogenic hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) HFC-365mfc
						(CH<sub>3</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>3</sub>, 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluorobutane), HFC-245fa (CHF<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>3</sub>, 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane), HFC-227ea (CF<sub>3</sub>CHFCF<sub>3</sub>, 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane),
						and HFC-236fa (CF<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>3</sub>, 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoropropane). In situ measurements are from the global monitoring sites of the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases
						Experiment (AGAGE), the System for Observations of Halogenated Greenhouse Gases in Europe (SOGE), and Gosan (South Korea). We include the first halocarbon
						flask sample measurements from the Antarctic research stations King Sejong and Troll. We also present measurements of archived air samples from both hemispheres
						back to the 1970s. We use a two-dimensional atmospheric transport model to simulate global atmospheric abundances and to estimate global emissions. HFC-365mfc
						and HFC-245fa first appeared in the atmosphere only ∼1 decade ago; they have grown rapidly to globally averaged dry air mole fractions of 0.53 ppt (in parts per
						trillion, 10<sup>−12</sup>) and 1.1 ppt, respectively, by the end of 2010. In contrast, HFC-227ea first appeared in the global atmosphere in the 1980s and has since grown
						to ∼0.58 ppt. We report the first measurements of HFC-236fa in the atmosphere. This long-lived compound was present in the atmosphere at only 0.074 ppt in 2010.
						All four substances exhibit yearly growth rates of >8% yr<sup>-1</sup> at the end of 2010. We find rapidly increasing emissions for the foam-blowing compounds HFC-365mfc and
						HFC-245fa starting in ∼2002. After peaking in 2006 (HFC-365mfc: 3.2 kt yr<sup>-1</sup>, HFC-245fa: 6.5 kt yr<sup>-1</sup>), emissions began to decline. Our results for these two
						compounds suggest that recent estimates from long-term projections (to the late 21st century) have strongly overestimated emissions for the early years of the
						projections (∼2005–2010). Global HFC-227ea and HFC-236fa emissions have grown to average values of 2.4 kt yr<sup>-1</sup> and 0.18 kt yr<sup>-1</sup> over the 2008–2010 period,
						respectively.

						A robust methodology was developed to compute population-weighted daily measures of ambient air pollution for use in time-series studies of acute health effects.
						Ambient data, including criteria pollutants and four fine particulate matter (PM) components, from monitors located in the 20-county metropolitan Atlanta area over
						the time period of 1999–2004 were normalized, spatially resolved using inverse distance-square weighting to Census tracts, denormalized using descriptive spatial models,
						and population-weighted. Error associated with applying this procedure with fewer than the maximum number of observations was also calculated. In addition to providing
						more representative measures of ambient air pollution for the health study population than provided by a central monitor alone and dampening effects of measurement error
						and local source impacts, results were used to evaluate spatial variability and to identify air pollutants for which ambient concentrations are poorly characterized.
						The decrease in correlation of daily monitor observations with daily population-weighted average values with increasing distance of the monitor from the urban center was
						much greater for primary pollutants than for secondary pollutants. Of the criteria pollutant gases, sulfur dioxide observations were least representative because of the
						failure of ambient networks to capture the spatial variability of this pollutant for which concentrations are dominated by point source impacts. Daily fluctuations in PM of
						particles less than 10 µm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) mass were less well characterized than PM of particles less than 2.5 µm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) mass because
						of a smaller number of PM10 monitors with daily observations. Of the PM2.5 components, the carbon fractions were less well spatially characterized than sulfate and nitrate
						both because of primary emissions of elemental and organic carbon and because of differences in measurement techniques used to assess these carbon fractions.
